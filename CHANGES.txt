v3.0a2  2025-03-21 -- First (partial) implementation of a planobs CLI.
                   -- Multiple sources, with associated calibrators are possible now.
v2.0.3  2020-12-10 -- Bug fix: The option of only one subband is back.
                   -- Minor wording updates.
                   -- Velocity information added to the summary (vel. resolution in full bandwidth and per channel).
                   -- Kunming added as a possible e-EVN station.
                   -- Dash GUI changes: the setup options are now always visible and the observation can be recomputed
                      when the user is in a different tab.
                   -- Dash GUI changes: Instead of asking for start and end times of the observation, now it asks for
                      start time (date and time) and duration of the observation to simplify user input.
                   -- Dash GUI changes: (finally!) fixed the slight offset in height between the start date and start time.
                   -- Fixed example in README  that had one comma missing and one extra bracket.
                   -- New Feature: now you can obtain the times at which the target source is observable (instead of just providing them).
v2.0.2  2020-11-30 -- Updated the SEFD from Kunming as it was previously wrong.
                   -- Minor tweaks in the graphical (Dash) interface for a better interaction with the user.
                   -- Now sliders also match the color style of the rest of the page.
v2.0.1  2020-11-19 -- Bug fix: Subbands and channels tuple were getting lost when restarting the server sometimes.
                   -- Added character limit of 30 in the source name through the server to avoid slowness of the system.
                   -- (in the Dash GUI) Network selection position has been swapped with the band selection menu.
                   -- (in the command-line): source name can also be input now to obtain the source coordinates.
v2.0    2020-11-18 -- Target source can now be processed by providing source name.
                   -- New first-window to select the band. Avoids confusion among users.

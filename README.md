# VLBI Calculator


This is an on-going project to replace the current [EVN Calculator](http://www.evlbi.org/cgi-bin/EVNcalc.pl) to an improved version that allows you to know how much time each antenna can observe an specified source during a give observing time.

Still under development, and it is up and running under a temporary [Heroku server](https://vlbi-calculator.herokuapp.com) (it may be down from time to time due to current bugs).

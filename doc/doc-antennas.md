This tool has been written with a main focus on observations with the [European VLBI Network](https://www.evlbi.org) (EVN). This implies that some stations, which can also belong to other networks, are placed under the EVN group to avoid duplicates. The network selection would select them when required in any case.

Note that through EVN proposals any user can also apply for the participation of other networks like the VLBA, KVN, or eMERLIN. See [the documentation at the EVN webpage](https://www.evlbi.org/using-evn) for more information.


#### Connected interferometers

Connected interferometers as the Karl G. Jansky VLA, the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), or the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) can operate with a single antenna or phasing up the entire array.

Right now we only provide the two options for the VLA (VLA 1, or VLA 27, respectively), for further information [see the VLA in VLBI reference at the NRAO site](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/obsguide/modes/vlbi). For the rest of connected interferometers this tool assumes that the entire array is being used.

In the case of ALMA we consider the participation of all 37 telescopes that can be available for VLBI use.

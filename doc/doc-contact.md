This tool has been developed and is maintained by [Benito Marcote](https://bmarcote.github.io/) at the [Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE)](https://www.jive.eu) to support observations with the [European VLBI Network (EVN)](https://www.evlbi.org/). The code and documentation is publicly available at [GitHub](https://github.com/bmarcote/vlbi_calculator) under GNU GPLv3.0+.

Note that the full program can also be used without launching a web server. We provide all tools to allow an interactive use through the command-line (i.e. without a graphical interface) that can be easily integrated into any Python program.

Do not hesitate to provide feedback either at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bmarcote/vlbi_calculator/issues) or by [contacting the author](mailto:marcote@jive.eu).

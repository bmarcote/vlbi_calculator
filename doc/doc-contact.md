This tool has been developed and is maintained at the [Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE)](https://www.jive.eu) by Benito Marcote. The code and documentation is publicly available at [GitHub](https://github.com/bmarcote/vlbi_calculator) under GNU GPL v3.0.

Note that the full program can also be used without launching a server. We provide all tools to allow its interactive use without a graphical interface or to be easily integrated into any Python program.

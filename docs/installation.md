# Installation

If you want to install PlanObs in your own machine, then you can simply run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install vlbiplanobs
```
```

Or via any other way you are used to do to install Python PyPy packages.

This should install all necesary dependencies and vlbliplanobs.

**Note that the current PlanObs version requires Python > 3.11.**



Once installed, you should find two binaries in your terminal:

* `planobs` - the version running through the CLI.
* `planobs-server` - the version running through the GUI.
